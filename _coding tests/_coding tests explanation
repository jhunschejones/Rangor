class test 1 and 2 were used when testing how to require a set of classes
across two files

--------12/04/17--------
"class_test3.rb" is the first time I was able to write classes that could store,
retrieve, and do math on the health variable. Uses it's own classes, NOT the 
game "engine.rb" file.

'writing_test.rb" and "writing_test2.rb" use the real game "engine.rb" to store 
and recall the health variable across two files. Some early work was done here
to lay the ground work for the inventory variable but it is commented out.

inventory_test1.rb is a self-contained test to figure out how to serialize an
array of items, store it to a file, recall the value and add to it, then store
the new array to the file

inventory_test2.rb serializes an array of items, stores it to a file, recalls
the value and adds to it, then stores the new array to the file using the real
game engine

-------12/07/17--------
pop_test.rb is a test using the actual game engine to remove an item from the 
inventory and save the new inventory back to the file

fast_track.rb is a way to short cut from the main directory to whichever 
file I'm currently working on
