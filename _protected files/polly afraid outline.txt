As Polly the mouse, you live a simple existence.
You run a small supply shop in a sewer drain somewhere downtown.
One day you recieve a important summons from a messanger of Rangor.

It reads:
        Greetings subject. I send tidings from the stronghold of Rangor.
        Your assistance is requested on a mission of upmost secrecy.
        I understand this is a busy season for your shop, but I promise
        you will be rewarded handsomly for your assistance.

What do you do with the message?
**************************************************
1. Follow the messenger back to help right away.
   (You are not afraid of any danger!)

2. Send a message back saying you will follow shortly. 
   (As a mouse, you are naturally timid and want to see  
    what this is all about first.)

3. Ignore the mesage and continue on with your work.
   (Surely there is someone better suited for this type 
    of thing!)
