As Polly the mouse, you live a simple existence.
You run a small supply shop in a sewer drain somewhere downtown.
One day you recieve a important summons from a messanger of Rangor.

It reads:
        Greetings subject. I send tidings from the stronghold of Rangor.
        Your assistance is requested on a mission of upmost secrecy.
        I understand this is a busy season for your shop, but I promise
        you will be rewarded handsomly for your assistance.

What do you do with the message?
**************************************************
1. Follow the messenger back to help right away.
   (You are not afraid of any danger!)

2. Send a message back saying you will follow shortly. 
   (As a mouse, you are naturally timid and want to see  
    what this is all about first.)

3. Ignore the mesage and continue on with your work.
   (Surely there is someone better suited for this type 
    of thing!)

> 1
Clearly you have the hart of a warrior mouse!
The messanger is suprised, but gladly leads you back to the
rangor stronghold.

You are provided with temporary quarters in the guest wing and
the messanger leaves to alert Rangor that you have arrived.

What do you do while you wait?
**************************************************
1. Curl up in a warm corner to rest for the adventure ahead.
2. Explore the room.
3. Leave the room to explore the stronghold.

(After the long journey, poly is tired. This will be the players first intro
to the health metric:
Choice 1 gives health 10
Choice 2 gives health 9
Choice 3 gives health 8)

The messenger returns and lets you know Rangor will see you now

You enter the gilded throne room of Rangor, the king of the rats. 
"Polly," he calls out as you enter,
"I am so glad you could assist me at such short notice."

You are impressed he knows your name, but he continues.

"I do not wish to be blunt, but I find myself in a tough spot. As a result
of what some consider my lenient treatment of the other creatures who 
participate in our rat society, there is a strong faction rising amongst
the rats who wish to start a revolt. Normally, I would involve the rat
army to solve such an upheaval, but with the fast approaching winter months
I cannot afford the luxury of time."

"My spies on the far side of the river have let me know there will be a key
meeting amongst the leaders of the rebel movement that will occur in two
days time. I have called you to my side in this dire hour to ask that you 
sneak into this meeting among the wait staff and confirm the identity of 
those in attendance. With this information confirmed, I will hopefully be
able to quickly deploy my guard to put this to rest."


You travel across the river using the tunnels and locate the venue Rangor 
told you about. It is located behind a grocery store in an abandoned dumpster.
You remember Rangor gave you a hint on how you should be able to sneak in.
